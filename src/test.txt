The night was unusually quiet in the little town of Hollow Pines. A soft mist clung to the cobblestone streets, curling around the lampposts like curious fingers. In the distance, a lone dog barked once, then fell silent, leaving the world wrapped in stillness. Evelyn tightened her coat around her shoulders as she walked, the crunch of gravel under her boots the only sound she could hear.

She carried with her an old brass key, one that had been passed down in her family for generations. No one had ever told her what it unlocked, only that someday she would “know when the time was right.” Tonight, though, something pulled at her instincts—an unshakable sense that the answer lay close. She stopped at the entrance of the abandoned train station, the windows boarded up, the doors chained with rust.

Evelyn pressed the key into her palm, heart racing. As the mist swirled thicker around her, she noticed a faint glow seeping through the cracks of the boarded windows. Her breath caught in her throat. Perhaps this was what her grandmother had meant all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward toward the locked doors, the key cold and heavy in her hand.
